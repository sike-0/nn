# Conclusions

### Face Extraction
- MTCNN doesn't give much good results
- NudeNet is good but wastes compute on detecting other things
- retina-face is by the best. Just uses a lot of resources. (Works good on Google Colab but, not recommended for local machine)

### Face recognition
- Facenet works just right
